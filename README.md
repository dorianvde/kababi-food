# Kababi Food

## Project

The project was an integration was a whole new restaurant: Kababi Food. 
We've been given a template and some assets, so we had to figure things out, especially about integrating some texts to mimic like they're part of the "background", or whatsoever. 

## Tools used

* HTML,
* CSS,
* SCSS.
